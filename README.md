# Arduino-Project-3-LEDs-with-3-Push-Buttons



## Overview
This is a basic Arduino project designed using **Tinkercad Circuits**. It demonstrates how to control three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) using push buttons. The circuit is ideal for beginners learning about digital input/output and breadboard wiring.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- Breadboard
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3 Push buttons
- 6 Resistors (3 for LEDs, 3 for buttons – typically 220Ω for LEDs, 10kΩ for buttons)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable (for power and programming)

## Functionality
- Each push button controls one LED.
- When a button is pressed, the corresponding LED lights up.
- This setup helps understand digital input (buttons) and output (LEDs) in Arduino.

## How It Works
- The buttons are connected to digital pins with pull-down resistors.
- When pressed, the button sends a HIGH signal to the Arduino.
- The Arduino then turns ON the corresponding LED.
